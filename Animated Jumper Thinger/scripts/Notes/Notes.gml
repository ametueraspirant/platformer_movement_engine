//yspeed reverses itself when jumping off walls when not holding w, creating a stronger downdraft
//the faster up you go

//work on some proof of concept enemy designs and level design

//create ways to exit roll early

//spiffy up roll code and put in back rolling

//look up cameras in games and see how they tick

//wall dashing up into a ceiling causes the character's head to get stuck in it.

//player slide lasts forever
